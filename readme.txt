.XML -> datasets previously trained with: 

opencv_traincascade -data data -vec positives.vec -bg bg.txt -numPos APROX_NO_OF_POSITIVES_MINNUS_5% -numNeg HALF_OF_THAT_NUMBER -numStages NO_OF_STAGES -w 20 -h 20

***//***
NO_OF_STAGES => TIME RISE EXPONENTIALLY

APROX_NO_OF_POSITIVES_MINUS_5% => -5% TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE STAGES

SAVIOR.PY => FORMAT YOUR TEXT FILE HOWEVER YOU LIKE, YOU`LL PROBABLY NEED IT WHEN UPLOADING TO A SERVER

DOWNLOAD_IMAGE_BY_LINK.PY => IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO, FETCHES IMAGES BY LINK, RESIZES THEM THEN ADD A BLACK AND WHITE FILTER

CASCADES.XML => WATCH DATA SET TRAINED BY ME, BUT DUE TO LACK OF PROCESSING POWER IN THE DIGITAL OCEAN SERVER, IT WON`T RUN PAST 16 GENERATIONS.

OTHER CASCADES USED ARE CREATED IN THIS SAME MANNER
